# Personal Portfolio Version 2

**Demo:** https://solomonkamanga.github.io/personal-portfolio-v2/

## Project

**Technology: HTML & CSS**

This is the second iteration of my personal portfolio website. This project was made with HTML and CSS, but with no JavaScript. It was an experiment to see if I could easily develop such a website without using JavaScript or libraries such as JQuery.
